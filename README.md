# Team WAR to Team Wins Correlation
## Version 1.0.0
This code was put together thanks to the amazing folks putting the work in at Pybaseball.

The purpose is to see the correlation between Team WAR to Team Wins. It's written to the 2021 season and is split by 
Batting fWAR, Pitching fWAR, Batting bWAR, and Pitching bWAR at the team level.

I will work on adding Run Differential to the Team Standings so we can see how that correlates.
